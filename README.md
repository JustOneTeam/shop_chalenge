# About This project : 

This project is about a store that has various products for sale; These products are classified in different groups, <br>
for example, different brands and models of laptops are included in the group of laptops, <br>
as well as other products in the same way. <br>
In this project, our team has written a piece of JavaScript code in which, using arrays and objects, <br>
it has considered the most optimal data structure to store the information of this store's products. <br>
